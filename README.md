# Deni-refactoring-hw1.github.io

Per the user story and "tech lead's" instruction, I focused on the site's functionality to make sure all links were working and displayed correctly. I found that the link in the nav bar was missing, so this has been corrected.

Additionally, alts were added to images for accessiblity, as well as media screen functionality for screens smaller than 800px.

Furthermore, the HTML code was revised to semantic tags to clean it up, which resulted in a few changes as noted to the CSS. To increase the efficiency of the CSS, I tried consolidating as many of the selectors and properties as possible, and organized them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.

Lastly, the page was missing it's head title and this was also corrected.
